# Code cleanup or refractering the Horiseon website
Added a more descriptive title tag with the companies name and functions
next I corrected the hyperlink for search engine optimization, I added the ID needed
Next I added descriptive alt tags for each of th images
next I condensed many of the class tag, one class each area 
used the Header, Section and main tags to help cleanup and cut down on the div tags.
